# Ant-Algorithm
Self learning ant algorithm.

Ants are running randomly from a starting point to a food place and return to the nest.
While they where running, they drop pheromons. The wind then takes the pheromons way. 
After a while thr ants follow only the strongest path of pheromons, whoch is theoretical the fastest.
