# Ant-Algorithm
Self learning ant algorithm.

===Currently in development===

Written in Python 3.7
Needs matplotlib

Theoretic model:
==============

Ants are running randomly from a starting point to a food place and return to the nest. While they where running, they drop pheromons. The wind then takes the pheromons way. After a while thr ants follow only the strongest path of pheromons, which is theoretical the fastest.

Structure
========

Ants:
- Creation
- Moving
- Smelling
- Pheromons

Field:
- Start
- Target
- Borders/Obstacles
- Collecting pheromons
- Wind

Visualization:
- Drawing of field
- Dynamic displaying of ants

Common Functions:
- Some basic functions
